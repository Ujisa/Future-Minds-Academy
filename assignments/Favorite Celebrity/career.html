                            <b>In spring 2005, while still in college, Del Rey registered a seven-track extended play
                                with
                                the United States Copyright <br> Office; the application title was Rock Me Stable with
                                another title,
                                Young Like Me, also listed. A second extended play, <br> From the End, was also recorded
                                under Del
                                Rey's stage name at the time, May Jailer. Between 2005 and <br> 2006, she recorded an
                                acoustic album,
                                Sirens, under the May Jailer project, which leaked on <br> the internet in mid-2012.</b>

                                At her first public performance in 2006 for the Williamsburg Live Songwriting
                                Competition, Del Rey met Van Wilson, <br> an A&R representative for 5 Points Records,
                                an independent label owned by David Nichtern. In 2007,<br> while a senior at Fordham,
                                she submitted a demo tape of acoustic tracks, No Kung Fu, to 5 Points <br>, which
                                offered
                                her a recording contract for $10,000. She used the money to relocate to Manhattan
                                Mobile <br> Home Park, a trailer park in North Bergen, New Jersey, and began working
                                with producer David Kahne. <br> Nichtern recalled: <br><br><br> <i> "Our plan was to get
                                    it all organized
                                    and have a record to go and she'd be touring right after she <br> graduated from
                                    college.
                                    Like a lot of artists, she morphed. When she first came to us, she <br> was playing
                                    plunky
                                    little acoustic guitar, had sort of straight blonde hair, <br> very cute young
                                    woman. A
                                    little bit dark, but very intelligent. We heard that. <br> But she very quickly kept
                                    evolving."</i>

                                In 2011, Del Rey uploaded self-made music videos for her songs "Video Games" and "Blue
                                Jeans" to YouTube, featuring <br> vintage footage interspersed with shots of her singing
                                on
                                her webcam. The "Video Games" music video became a viral internet <br> sensation, which
                                led
                                to Del Rey being signed by Stranger Records to release the song as her debut <br>
                                single. She
                                told The Observer: <br><br><br> <i> "I just put that song online a few months ago
                                    because it was my
                                    favorite. To be honest, it wasn't <br> going to be the single but people have really
                                    responded to it."</i> <br><br><br> The song earned her a Q award for "Next Big
                                Thing" in October 2011 and
                                an Ivor Novello for <br> "Best Contemporary Song" in 2012. <br>
